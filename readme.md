# Double to string conversion benchmark üßê

This project aims to compare performance of different C++ methods to convert double numbers to string.

Tis is test-function prototype that takes vector of numbers as argument and returns pair with method's working time and average length of strings in input vector.
```
std::pair<size_t, double> method_x(const std::vector<double> & numbers);
```

This project was written and tested only on Linux(we use Arch btw), so usage on other systems is experimental.
If you can help with testing on Windows or MacOS, contact us.

Already we have implemented 14 methods.

## Prerequisites
<mark>Have CMAKE, GCC, Qt, and boost installed</mark>

## Installation
Clone repository
```{bash}
$ git clone https://github.com/archy-co/doubleToString.git
```

## Usage
You can compile program manually using cmake.

Or you can python script that will compile and execute program:
```{bash}
$ python main.py 10 in.txt out.txt
```

To run python script you have to specify number of times that experiment will run, and two files: from first program will read data and second is to store results. These files doesn't require some specific names, as data is generated automatically at the beginning of each execution (if you have your specific input data you want to run just comment the line in python script that generates data) and is written to file that you specify.
  
After running program will print the minimum time for each method, and will check if all results of the method coinside

### Important!
Method #12 **write to file** runs about 75-80 times slower than other methods. Therefore in python script the number of runs to take min time is lower than for all the other methods by default. If you want, you can configure it for your own needs but current configurations are alright for normal run and comparison of times

## Results

All methods are in ```src/methods.cpp file```. Here is a table with time required for each method to convert 1GB file with doubles to strings.
